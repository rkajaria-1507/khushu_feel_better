              Hi honey. <br>
              Seems like you are having a good time, right? Well, no one is happier to see you happy
              more than me. I wish that you happiness all the time. Seeing and imagining you smile 
              and laugh the way you do just lights up my heart and mood. Every time I am feeling down
              and you cannot come to the phone, I just see your photos and us laughing and having a 
              good time and it makes me feel a whole lot better. <br>
              I wish that I was there with you, sharing that happiness with you, making the moment 
              last longer than it could. If I am there with you, I hope that I am holding you close 
              and enjoying the moment while it lasts. For whatever reason you are happy, it could be 
              you are having a good time with your friends, you are playing with viyaan and rivan, 
              or you are enjoying some time with yourself, I hope that you enjoy every moment of it 
              because you never know when or how it would change. <br>
              But no matter what, I am always gonna be there for you in your brightest moements, 
              cheering for you louder than anyone, even if no one else is, I will cheer for you so loudly, 
              it will make the others sound loud. <br>
              I hope you are hit with this kind of happiness and joy every day, every moment of your 
              life. And I hope that I am with you to experience some of it with you, together. <br>
              <br>
              I love you so much.

              Hey love. <br>
              I can see that you are not feeling the best right now. What happened? Overthinking? 
              Someone said something? Listen, none of that matters. First, go wash your face quickly. 
              Then, go and hug the penguin. If you are outside, repeat the first step. The next step for 
              either is to call me. IF I dont pick up for whatever reason (because I am an idiot and 
              nothign is more important right now for me than you because you are feeling sad), I want 
              you to give me 2 tight slaps next time you see me. <br>
              But either way, I want you to feel a little better, so we will play a game. I am thinking 
              of a word. You have 10 seconds to guess it. (Hint. it is our song). Befikar. You know that 
              when i first heard it, I didnt think much of it. But when i heard the lyrics and thought 
              about it, it has much more meaning than what it shows. It is such a nice word, Befikar. 
              The song means that whenever I am with you, whenever I see you, all my worries go away 
              and I am free. I am lost in you, your world. <br>
              Isn't that such a good meaning? Well, lets try it out. Lets take a few deep breaths together, 
              and take out all the bad thoughts and bin it. No matter what you are thinking. If you are 
              worried about something, or overthinking about someone saying something, just take out the 
              thoughts and bin it. If the problem is solvable, we will solve it together, if it is not, 
              then answer this, is there any point in thinking about it? <br>
              If you are thinking, think about that. <br>
              I love you. You are not alone. You are loved. You are amazing.

    message: `
              For whatever dumb thing or serious thing I did to make you mad, I am sorry. <br>
              I am sure that there is some good reason for you to be mad at me and some stupid
              explanation on my part. But I hope that you know that I did not mean for you to get
              upset. <br>
              If there is a valid reason for me to act however I did, I hope that I am able to
              convey that message properly and I can make it up to you.
